# Neural Style Transfer
## Deep neural networks have shown astonishing results in object recognition and detection, some of the models are achieved near human-level performance. However, when the task is to generate artistic artifacts, the deep neural network is far behind. This project takes advantage of pre-trained convolutional neural networks and combines famous artistic style references to generate arts and improve the original paper that introduce the algorithm of neural style transfer.
